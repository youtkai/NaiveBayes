# Naive Bayes

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`naive_bayes.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform Naive Bayes classification using Python and the scikit-learn library. Naive Bayes is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, particularly in text classification and spam filtering.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/youtkai/NaiveBayes.git

cd naive-bayes

jupyter notebook

## Data

The notebook uses a sample dataset (data.csv) for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own dataset or use it as a starting point for your own Naive Bayes classification projects.
